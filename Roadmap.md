# What is AI Engineer?
Designing, building, and deploying AI systems that solve real world problems. Sits between:
- Software Engineer: 
- Machine Learning: 
- Data science: analyze data, predict something, develop models

AI Engineers take the Data Scientist's models and make them work in the real world setting by processing data, making decisions, and render actionable insights.
AI Engineers also work with more advanced models like Deep Learning and Neural Network models.
Goal is not to build models, it is to solve a problem and deliver value for the enterprise.

# Mathematics Necessary
Details can be seen in #1 Source below.

- High School Mathematics (Algebra, Trigonometry, Geometry)
- Linear Algebra
- Calculus
- Game Theory (Nash Equilibrium, Mean Max Strategy)
- Basic Statistics

Linear Algebra & Calculus are essential for understanding how models learn. Game Theory underpines some algorithms and is a foundation for Generative Adversarial Networks. Statistics is key for data validation and model evaluation.

# Data Science Necessary
Need the skills necessary for data preparation, validation, etc. Basically, normalization of the data.
Also exploratory data analysis to visualize the data.

# Traditional Machine Learning
You need to know which model to use to solve which problems. The answer to everything isn't Neural Networks.

Learn the algorithms that fall under:
- Classification: labels are preknown
- Clustering: labels are not preknown
- Regression
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning: trial and error, interacting with its environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards

How to evaluate the training, testing, and validation of a model. Consider different sampling or resampling techniques. Know about bootstrapping, cross validation, k-fold cross validation, or leave-one-out cross validation. What are the metrics to use to evaluate your model (mean absolute vs mean squared error).

# Deep Learning
At the heart of modern AI, especially for generative AI.

- Understand the architecture of DL (ANN, CNN, RNN, GNN, GRU, LSTM) and how it differs from traditional ML.
- Understand the concept of neurons and the perceptron.
- What is an activation functions ( ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh).
- Hidden layer, input layer, output layer.
- Forward pass, backward pass, back propagation.
- Loss function, and how to calculate it.
- How to train the neural network.
- Optimization Functions: Understand the gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, RMS prop, momentum - SGD, Adam, Adamw, etc.
- Vanishing Radiant Problem, Exploding Radiant Problem
- Understand the computational graphs being used to represent neural networks
- Mini batch gradient descent
- He initialization and why its being used
- Batch Normalization, Layer Normalization
- Residual connections, gradient clipping
- Bias and weights
- Venum gradient problem, exploding gradient problem
- Overfitting
- Random Forest vs Dropout vs L1 regularization vs L2 regularization
- Descriminative vs Degenerative models
- Autoencoders
- Reconstruction
- Path convolution, Depthwise separable convolution
- Pooling

# Generative AI
- Generator
- Discriminator
- Mode Collapse
- Transformers (Do pretraining without Pytorch so you can completely understand)

# Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Engram a modular chatbot for LLMs
- Predicting the next word
- Key LLMs (GPT, Llama, Falcon, Gemma, Claude from Anthropic)
- Hugging Face
